# Raspberry Pi 4-B Bare-Metal

Hello, this is a low-level bootloader project aiming to create a bridge between physical devices and IDEs.

> 🔭🔬 rpi4-baremetal is a new project on currently under development.
> With the future updates, it will have a better structure and more refined code.

## You can do somethings with a bootloader:

- Execute efficient and well-optimized code directly on hardware.
- Develop your own secure and fully personalized devices.
- Understand how a computer works before the operating system starts.
- Perform deep testing on low-level software.
- Tune programming languages for best performance in real systems.

🐬 I'm currently working on this project,, _sometimes coding, sometimes just chilling._
🐳 I will update the project files to provide a more comprehensive view.

Take it easy, try it in your own projects. And please don't forget:

### Different architectures need different languages, code styles, and lifes.
So just try to understand -- and buy your flight ticket to your project.
