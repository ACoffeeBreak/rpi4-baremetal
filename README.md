### Ongoing Project:
# Raspberry Pi 4-B Bare-Metal

Hello, this is a low-level bootloader project aiming to create a bridge between physical devices and IDEs.

## You can do something with a bootloader:

- Execute efficient and well-optimized code directly on hardware.
- Develop your own secure and fully personalized devices.
- Understand how a computer works before the operating system starts.
- Perform deep testing on low-level software.
- Tune programming languages for best performance in real systems.

I'm currently working on this project,, _sometimes coding, sometimes just chilling._
I will update the project files for get a more comprehensive view.

Take it easy, try it in your own projects. And please don't forget:
### Different architectures need different languages, code styles, and lifes. So just try to understand and buy your flight ticket to your project.
