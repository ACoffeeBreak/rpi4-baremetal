# Access Control Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the access control guidelines for the project, ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific files and areas of the repository. It is critical for maintaining project security and integrity, particularly for sensitive files.

## Sensitive Areas
The following areas of the project are considered sensitive and should only be accessed by authorized personnel:

- **Configuration Files** (e.g., `config/`, `settings/`)
- **Encryption Keys** (e.g., `keys/`)
- **Private APIs** (e.g., `src/private/`)
- **Password/Token Management** (e.g., `src/auth/`)

## Access Levels
There are three main levels of access:

1. **Admin Access** (Full access to all files)
   - **Who should have it:** Project lead, Security engineers, Senior developers
   - **Permissions:**
     - Full read/write access to all files and repositories.
     - Ability to manage collaborators and permissions.

2. **Developer Access** (Access to most files, but limited for security-sensitive sections)
   - **Who should have it:** Developers actively working on the project
   - **Permissions:**
     - Read/write access to most project files (code, documentation, etc.).
     - Limited access to configuration files, sensitive API keys, and encryption material.

3. **Read-Only Access** (Access to documentation and non-sensitive code)
   - **Who should have it:** Contributors, External collaborators
   - **Permissions:**
     - Read access to public files and non-sensitive code.

## Department Access
The following departments and personnel should have restricted access to the project files as outlined below:

- **Development Team:** 
  - Full access to code, libraries, and development documentation. 
  - Limited access to configuration and sensitive API keys.

- **Security Team:** 
  - Full access to all sensitive and security-related files.
  - Read/write access to encryption keys and password management.

- **Operations Team:** 
  - Limited access to deployment scripts and related files.
  - No access to development or sensitive data.

## How to Request Access
If you need access to a restricted area of the project, please submit a request to the project administrator. All requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Special Notes
- Access to sensitive data, such as encryption keys or private APIs, should only be granted when absolutely necessary.
- All users should use strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, to access the project repository.

## Monitoring and Auditing
Access to sensitive files will be logged, and any suspicious activity will be reviewed promptly. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with the access policy.
